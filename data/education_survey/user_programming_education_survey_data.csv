Timestamp,Have Programming classes in University prepared you working within software (i.e. building real software projects),"Have you felt required to incorporate self learning unrelated to university courses to grow your understanding of building real software systems (i.e. web applications, mobile apps, CLI tools)",What do you feel university misses when it comes to preparing students for work life after graduation,If you could include any classes or courses in the current curriculum to improve your employability after university what would you add
2/22/2023 17:12:05,No,Yes,- working on large software - working with code others have written,"Wouldn't add anything, more likely to remove some of the software engineering related ones as they were more of a hindrance and stick with more theoretical/ cutting edge research courses which are more interesting and better taught and learn the job preparation stuff outside of uni"
2/22/2023 17:13:01,The team project we complete in our third year does a good job of introducing you to working with software and a devops approach - however that is the only exampl,Yes,Working with larger scale projects and also working in teams with a variety of different members (such as senior devs),"I would include classes/course relating to setting up CI/CD environments such as pipelines (we get taught the reasons for doing this but not actually much experience of it). Also additional stuff relating to how to improve the software process, such as pre-commit tools."
2/22/2023 17:18:26,Yes,Yes,What employers value,"Some sort of non-compulsary class on building CV, interview prep etc"
2/22/2023 17:44:53,Yes,Yes,"More supportive learning , more work experience incorporated eg like level 3 group project ",
2/22/2023 18:01:51,somewhat -  i do not think university is supposed to do this but in some extend it does,Yes,"nothing really, the university (Academia) and industry are different things and i think universities as of now provide us with good enough tools (a combination of theory and practice) to do well in industry","emotional intelligence and social classes, sadly many cs students (and people in general) lack these skills"
2/22/2023 18:57:58,No,Yes,Making the jump between how things are done in theory/an academic setting versus how things are actually done in real life.,"Literally mandatory industrial experience. Software Engineering does it, no idea why computing science is exempt. Its also standard practice for people doing apprenticeships or even some college courses. It is high time that universities recognize that most people take on their degrees with the intention of working in industry, and adequately prepare them for it."
2/22/2023 21:29:38,No,Yes,Too much theoretical and research focus. Needs more coursework focused on actual product development ,"A follow up course to web application development 2. 
A career focused course giving students tools they need for landing and succeeding in jobs"
2/22/2023 21:30:56,Yes,Yes,Not enough attention is put into teaching industry standards,"A course focused on teaching students how best to approach new technologies, as the industry moves quickly its important to be able to keep up with new technologies."
2/22/2023 21:31:09,Kind of,Yes,"Everything. Courses are too research-based and very specific. Hence, unrelated to real software systems. ","More courses such as year 3 team project. software engineering projects. Mobile app, webb app courses. "
2/22/2023 21:48:51,Yes,Yes,Testing / build scripts and management on larger software projects / Jumping into a giant code base and getting up to speed on it and make meaningful contributions,"Statistical methods, Build scripts / management, Testing "
2/22/2023 22:00:12,yes but only to some extent i.e. additional learning is probably needed. but if i had to choose between yes and no i'd say yes.,Yes,not enough preparation to help apply for grad jobs.,more web application development courses. perhaps something that is a step-up from WAD2 (but keep WAD2 as well). also a mobile app development course would be good.
2/23/2023 0:18:27,No,Yes,up-to-date technology such as cloud or web development (e.g.: React/Vue),Cloud technologies or something related to devops
2/23/2023 8:13:02,No,No,"they dont put enough emphasis on sooftware development, just small coding coursework.","software development modules, be it more in depth design and analysis."
2/23/2023 12:15:55,Yes,Yes,"For students who don't have a strong techy background, some more practical help on non-coding stuff such as setting up development environments, how to host websites, getting to grips with the command line, installing external libraries into code, writing requirements.txt etc. I've spent hours googling how to do these, and I still don't feel that confident tbh. ","Maybe some sort of optional short course for non-programming tasks like setting up development environments, web app hosting, virtual envs, command line basics etc."
2/23/2023 12:34:34,No,Yes,"How software concepts are put into a final product, i.e how does Java turn into something tangible ","Classes on current development trends covering job ready skills for final year students this could be coverage of Frontend, backend, full stack and devops explaining in detail what the subjects are"
2/23/2023 15:10:34,"Most classes have been useful to gain the fundamental knowledge, but further research and working on own projects is required to familiarse yourself with the functionality that each programming language provides.",Yes,The stages of design when developing a piece of software. The work that is done before the programming begins.,Business Analysis and Technology
2/23/2023 19:42:03,"I don't know, most of my programming skills are self-thought.",Yes,"The University trains great Java engineerings for megacorp using SCRUM, outside that you are on your own.","I am honestly not sure, this is heavily dependent on which sub-field of CS one wants to be employed in. The university does an adequate job preparing people for corporate software engineering, but not much more. To be fair there is no need for that many specialists, nor do most people want to get into deep waters, but it would be nice to have the option."
2/24/2023 12:02:07,Yes,No,Working in a team hierarchy where you aren't the same Level as others but have a senior above you etc,"More diverse range of language options, since a lot like react are getting more and more popular "
3/1/2023 10:53:58,No,Yes,Real programming in a system,"Job ready classes like (Frontend, backend, devops, data, systems) or industry professionals explaining what they are looking for and what is done on the job"
3/1/2023 14:54:56,No,Yes,"CV prep, what is done on job","React, better web dev classes, how programming languages are used in industry"
