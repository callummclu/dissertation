Here's an overview of the structure as it stands:

[] `data/` data you acquire during the project
[x] `src/` source code for your project
[x] `status_report/` the status report submitted in December
[x] `dissertation/` source and for your project dissertation

## Important

        * Include clear instructions in the relevant directories to make this possible -->
